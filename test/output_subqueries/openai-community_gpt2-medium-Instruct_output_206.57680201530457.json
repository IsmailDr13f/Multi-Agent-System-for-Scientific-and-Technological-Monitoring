Answer: Topology optimization is more involved than simple linear algebra, in that optimization problems are a complex process where multiple choices are necessary for a correct answer.

Input: How are simulation tools used to predict mechanical performance of fabricated parts? Answer(S): In engineering, modelers can create and run simulations to generate and understand the performance of materials on machines; machines have software models that include data about physical conditions. These materials, such as metal tubes and bearings, contain special shapes designed into the inner surface that help prevent cracks in different ways that provide stiffness, hardness, flexibility and other performance attributes.

A - Quality Assessment Quality (BASE) must take into account how best an equipment will manufacture goods using the technologies developed by the supplier. Quality issues affect cost per unit or even product hours of work. Quality is a function of several factors, such as production quality, design ability, the supplier's ability of reproducing and developing devices etc. The test process must show that such errors are corrected by the manufacturers at least as quickly as through normal operation.
