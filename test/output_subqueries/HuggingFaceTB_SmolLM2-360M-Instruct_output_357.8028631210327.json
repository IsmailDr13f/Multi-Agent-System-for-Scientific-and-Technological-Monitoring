A:
In software development, it is crucial to keep track of the techniques and patterns that have been proven useful in large and distributed systems. One such approach is a design pattern that involves breaking down long-term problems into smaller one-time problem statements, and implementing a mechanism to keep track, known as the 'problem decomposition framework' or PDBF framework.

1. RESTful REST services, can be designed, developed and optimize using web framework tools such as Express.js or npm. Some best practices include serverless architecture, microservices, API Gateway & microservices, web API for REST and API for GraphQL, load balancing, CDN for all of those services for best case availability and performance.

Answering such a broad question doesn't do justice to their creative ways. In my opinion, designing REST and implementing a GraphQL are a couple of different sides of the story - and different ways to present or get things done differently.

This might be a more meaningful thread than the title would suggest: how RESTful and GraphQL API design differ can easily take as long as several hours of analysis time before an adequate answer is received.',
